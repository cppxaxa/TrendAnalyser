Adding a new module

Add new path to Path.cs
Changes to Path.cs check path function
Add new Trend_Analyser_Connector.cs









Try to completely understand the problem or else your time will be wasted

Try to gather whatever information is available or related from trusted/untrusted legal/illegal sources

Try to gather related topics/concepts/softwares/packages that may help to solve the pr
oblem

Now we have incomprehensible data
	Analyse the data
	try to get all information in variables or macros
	Write a program to analyse and parse data
	We found given information is wrong...Max value 255
	Data visualizer may help for large data - OpenCV

Now we have rough idea how the data is

Apply your first solution
	In less time, prefer trusted snippets/libraries

Make a output format, it was specified


Our solution can work on worst data, but the given data was fabricated so we can have optimized solutions too but we were not bothered

e.g. our program can work on rotated shapes also but there were no rotated shapes

e.g. fabricated data may be again generated ... reverse engineering
